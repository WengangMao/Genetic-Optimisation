# Genetic-Optimisation

Implement of Genetic algorithm for routing optimisation

In this code, we will try to accomplish the following modules:

  1, a weater downloading module
  
  2, a ship performance (fatigue/fuel) model
  
  3, a dynamic programming combined with genetic optimisation

First, we will have to learn how to use python
Second, we need to know a bit about the mathematical optimisation algorithm
